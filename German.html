  <h2>Why did I learn German?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I am a Language addict. I love languages!</li>
    <li>I married German and that is awesome!</li>
    <li>I love travelling and learning new things.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>My German Language Journey</h2>
  <p>I am a definite language fan. I am a Filipina born in the Philippines, loves travelling and English is my second language. Sometimes, I use English more than my natiive tounge. I been to several countries because of work.I came from a humble
    family, struggled finding scholarship during my college years, became a mother of twin boys at the age of 19. It was not easy, it was very challenging as I have to manage things on my own but I will not change any step of my journey. It was all
    worth it. I worked in Hongkong as doestic helper, in Kuwait as Restaurant Manager and in Bahrain where I worked in Restaurants and managed to go back to the Corporate World. I met my Husband through a dating site during the time that I had just
    recently ended my old flame. This is the part where I started being curious with the German Language. </p>
  <p>Alright, I know you are here as you wanted to ace your German language as well. I can tell you, it is not a straight path. There will be alot of valley, rough roads and hills as we navigate the beauty of the German language but it will
    definetely pay it's way off sonner or later. I jnew how difficult it is to master the articles or the german sentence structure and all the ndings that depends wether a word is masculine or feminine or it is singular or plural. Here, we can look
    at the techniques and speak conversational german in no time. Of course, it will be a lot of work from us. You, as a learner and me as your coach. I would love to keep you motivated.</p>
